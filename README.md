# autograd_numpy
## This lil thing was done so i can visualize a quick prototype of what i will do in c++ with gpu support later.
## Implementations of the basic supported operations are at [ml/autograd](ml/autograd/), and some other operations are composition of multiple basic ops. 
## Optimizers (i will propably add more and use this repo to quick test an algorithm before implementing it in c++) are at [ml/nn/Optimizers/](ml/nn/Optimizers.py)
## Losses like cosine similarity cross entropy etc are at [ml/nn/losses](ml/nn/Losses.py)
## Theres also an example with the mnist dataset doing handwritten digits classification the results are below :
